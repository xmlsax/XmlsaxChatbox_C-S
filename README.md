# XmlsaxChatbox_C/S
Hey, there is a chatbox made xmlsax.



It has a server with no gui and a client with simple gui(tkinter).



It uses bsd socket api in client, and socketserver module from python in server.



**Note: Releases will only contain client but not server. **

License for server is GPLv3.0 and for client is BSDv2.
